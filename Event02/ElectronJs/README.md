### Abstract
Electron is a platform developed by GitHub that allows you to make cross-platform applications using web technologies.  
In this workshop we will explore this technology and touch the code by developing a small application.  
The workshop will be divided into two parts, the first is introductory, we will see the architecture of Electron and some APIs.  
In the second part we will develop together an application, exploring and putting into practice the APIs seen in the first part.
