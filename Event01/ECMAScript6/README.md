### Abstract
After years of waiting, on June 2015 it was officially the ES6 standard (aka ES2015), which introduces many new features to write complex and structured applications in JavaScript.  
The most famous Frontend libraries, such as Angular2 and React are already using the new language features and the Node.js community is taking great benefits from this new standard.  
In this talk we analyze some of the most important features, and we'll see how to use ES6 productively right away.
